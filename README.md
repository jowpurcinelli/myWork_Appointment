` Under development`

## 💻 Project
`myWork Appointment` Is a shceduling and admin control platform where costumers can make an appointment inside a platform where workers, job providers can organize the day schedule. 
This in an autoral app starting from the bottom. 
The idea is to develop the web, mobile and back-end platforms. Where the users can find the workers, schedule an appointment, and well... I am open to new ideas
